Dark theme for Fargo editor

I really enjoy working with dark themes - I just find myself more productive in them. Here's a nice Dark theme for for Fargo Editor. It's super simple to install, just Copy/Paste into your CSS tab under your personal settings. 

Testing (Fargo 1.27 - Chrome): 
This theme is in testing as I can't hit every browser. If it works for you, please let me know.
